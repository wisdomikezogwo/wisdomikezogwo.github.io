My name is Ikezogwo Wisdom. I am a research assistant at the Biosignal Processing, Instrumentation and Control (BSIC) Lab at Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. I am interested in the application of learning algorithms and control theory in the healthcare space. My interests in this regard span the entire gamut: prediction, classification, control, detection, interpretation, and decision making. During my undergraduate programme, I worked on machine learning models for classification of electrophysiological signals, which is very useful in disease diagnosis. My final year capstone project was on a technique for increasing the size of training datasets towards improving the performance of such classifiers. After the completion of my B.Sc. programme, I spent a few additional months working in the Lab on problems such as empirically deducing the spectral properties of EEG data and dimensionality reduction techniques applied to EEG data in the frequency domain. Currently, I work as a data scientist for a media startup whilst working remotely with the Lab. My next goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in the intersection of machine learning and computational neuroscience, all towards what I call “Auto healthcare”.

he received a Honours BSc in Computer Science from the
University of Toronto in 2007. He received a National Science Foundation
Graduate Research Fellowship in 2009, the C.V. Ramamoorthy Distinguished
Research Award in 2013, and the ECCV Best Paper Honorable Mention in 2016.
